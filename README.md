# WEDB1000-Case-Study
This website was created for fulfillment of a case study project for the Introduction to Website Development course at Nova Scotia Community College. This website showcases mobile-first design, HTML and CSS.
Case Study Instructions:
XYZ hospital is a multi specialty hospital that includes a number of departments, rooms, doctors, nurses, compounders, and other staff working in the hospital. Patients having different kinds of ailments come to the hospital and get checkup done from the concerned doctors. If required they are admitted in the hospital and discharged after treatment.

The aim of this case study is to design and develop a mockup/webpages for the hospital to display the public information about various departments and doctors working in the hospital. It also display records for regular patients, patients admitted in the hospital, the check up of patients done by the doctors, the patients that have been operated, and patients discharged from the hospital.

NOTE: 
As the website is build only using HTML and CSS, there is no functionality in the forms or login pages. 
Emergency Department, General Surgery and ICU are the only pages from the Departments section which have been populated, the rest of the department pages are placeholder links.
